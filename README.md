# The Plain v1 for blogc

A minimalist blogc theme, based on [a Jekyll theme](https://github.com/heiswayi/the-plain), that focuses on writing matters, made with passion for simplicity. A great, white clean theme for personal blog use. Made with [Sass](https://github.com/sass/sass) which automates the compression of the compiled CSS code, and cool **Jekyll layout** by [Anatol Broder](http://jch.penibelst.de/) for compressing the HTML code on-the-fly. Typeface used is [Fira Sans font](https://github.com/mozilla/Fira) by Mozilla.

The blogc variant is based on the final assets generated for the jekyll theme, so the Sass stuff is not available here, please check the [Jekyll theme repo](https://github.com/heiswayi/the-plain), if you need it.
